mineflayer - Minecraft multiplayer client game logic library and bot scripting
             interface.

Setting up build:

    Linux:

        1. Install prerequisites:
            $ sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree:
            $ mkdir ../mineflayer-build
            $ cd ../mineflayer-build/
        3. Configure with script debugging support (recommended):
            $ qmake ../mineflayer/mineflayer.pro
        OR configure headless which removes any dependency on an X server:
            $ EXTRA_CONFIG=headless qmake ../mineflayer/mineflayer.pro
        4. Build everything:
            $ make
        5. Optionally install libmineflayer-core.so to /usr/lib:
            $ INSTALL_ROOT=/usr sudo make install
            if you don't do this, you'll have to put the directory containing
            the .so in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable whenever you run mineflayer.

    Mac:

        1. Download the Qt SDK for Mac from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
        2. Create a build folder OUTSIDE the source code tree and cd to it.
        3. Configure:
            $ qmake -spec macx-g++ path/to/mineflayer.pro
        OR:
            $ EXTRA_CONFIG=headless qmake -spec macx-g++ path/to/mineflayer.pro
        4. Now whenever you want to build, use make.

    Windows:

        NOTE: these instructions are out of date. You don't need to do step 5 or
              probably steps 2 - 6 at all.

        1. Download and install the Qt SDK: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/
        2. Open mineflayer.pro with Qt Creator
        3. On the left click Projects.
        4. Edit build configuration: Release
        5. Build Steps -> qmake -> Details -> additional arguments: CONFIG+=no_3d
        6. On the left above the run button, change the active build to Release
        7. Build -> Build All
        8. This generates mineflayer.exe in your build directory. Typically
           you run bots from the command line. To do this you'll need to copy
           a bunch of DLLs from Qt. These DLLs are:
           * libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
           * mingwm10.dll
           * QtCore4.dll
           * QtGui4.dll
           * QtNetwork4.dll
           * QtScript4.dll
           * QtScriptTools4.dll

Running bots:

    mineflayer bot.js

    If the bot depends on any of the lib files you'll need to pass the lib
    folder like this:

    mineflayer -I<path_to_lib> bot.js

    Alternately, you can put the lib folder in an environment variable called
    MINEFLAYER_LIB.

    To connect to a server that requires authentication:

    mineflayer --url username@server --password 12345 bot.js

    NOTE: all parameters passed after the bot .js file are parameters passed to
    the bot script itself rather than mineflayer.

Running the useful examples (multi.js):

    The script examples/multi.js is a meta-script that includes most all of the
    useful bot scripts found in the examples/ directory. Here's an example
    invocation command from the build directory (this assumes you don't have a
    MINEFLAYER_LIB variable defined):

    ./mineflayer-script/mineflayer -I../mineflayer/mineflayer-script/lib/ --url BOT_USER_NAME@SERVER_HOSTNAME ../mineflayer/mineflayer-script/examples/multi.js --master=YOUR_USER_NAME --setup="jesusmode on" --setup="healthreport on"

    Explanations of the --master and --setup commands can be found in
    lib/chat_commands.js. If you and your bot are logged in, say "help" via chat
    for a list of known chat commands (such as "jesusmode" and "healthreport").

Documentation:
    * See doc/bot-api for comprehensive API documentation.
    * See libs/ for more utility functions.
    * See examples/ for examples of bot code.

    ECMAScript reference:
        http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/ecmascript.html

Running the test suite:

    Command will look something like:

    $ cd mineflayer-script
    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../mineflayer-build-desktop/mineflayer-core bin/run_tests ~/apps/minecraft-server-1.5/minecraft_server.jar ../../mineflayer-build-desktop/mineflayer-script/mineflayer
