State:

    state = {
        'time_passed': int number of seconds,
        'window_open': enum value (chest, inventory, nothing, etc),
        'invulnerable': bool (if you got hit by a zombie .1 sec ago),
    }

State:

    which entities are alive, and for each entity (also for myself):
         health
         position
         velocity
         yaw
         pitch
         how much oxygen bubbles it has left
         if it's a player
             inventory
             equipped item
             whether crouching
    for each block of the world,
         what block fills the space
         the metadata of the block filling the space
         if the block is a container, the contents
    what window is open, if any
    what item is held in hand (with window open, clicking an item)
    how much time has passed

Algorithm:

    parameters:
        goal_state: some subset of the state of the world. for example, "diamond sword is equipped". 
        start_state: the real state of the world when the algorithm is run

    
    until start_state contains goal_state:
        find an Action or whose effects fulfill the goal state
            use a map to find a small list of actions that can achieve goal state

        apply all applicable laws
        new goal state is the Action or Law's prereqs























    // set of nodes already evaluated
    closed_set = empty set

    // set of tentative nodes to be evaluated
    open_set = all states that can be obtained by reversing an action's effects and prereqs and applying that to goal_state

    // the list of frames we've followed to get here. a frame is [action, g_score_so_far]
    // g_score is actual score from start along optimal path.
    path = empty list


    current_state = goal_state
    while current_state not in start_state:
        action = find an action with an effect that is in current_state and prereqs that move current_state closer to being in start_state
        append action to path
