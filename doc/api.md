## Bot

### Properties

#### bot.entity

Your own entity. See `Entity`.

#### bot.entities

All nearby entities. This object is a map of entityId to entity.

#### bot.username

Use this to find out your own name.

#### bot.spawnPoint

Coordinates to the main spawn point, where all compasses point to.

#### bot.game.levelType

#### bot.game.dimension

#### bot.game.difficulty

#### bot.game.gameMode

#### bot.game.hardcore

#### bot.game.worldHeight

#### bot.game.maxPlayers

#### bot.players

List of people playing the game. A player looks like this:

```js
{
  username: 'player',
  ping: 28,
  entity: entity, // null if you are too far away
}
```

#### bot.isRaining

#### bot.settings.chat

Choices:

 * `enabled` (default)
 * `commandsOnly`
 * `disabled`

#### bot.settings.colorsEnabled

Default true, whether or not you receive color codes in chats from the server.

#### bot.settings.viewDistance

Choices:
 * `far` (default)
 * `far`
 * `normal`
 * `short`
 * `tiny`

#### bot.settings.difficulty

Same as from server.properties.

#### bot.settings.showCape

If you have a cape you can turn it off by setting this to false.

#### bot.experience.level

#### bot.experience.points

Total experience points.

#### bot.experience.progress

Between 0 and 1 - amount to get to the next level.

#### bot.health

Number in the range [0, 20] representing the number of half-hearts.

#### bot.food

Number, in the range [0, 20] representing the number of half-turkey-legs.

#### bot.foodSaturation

Food saturation acts as a food "overcharge". Food values will not decrease
while the saturation is over zero. Players logging in automatically get a
saturation of 5.0. Eating food increases the saturation as well as the food bar.


#### bot.physics

Edit these numbers to tweak gravity, jump speed, terminal velocity, etc.
Do this at your own risk.

#### bot.time.day

Time of the day, in ticks.

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000
ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long.

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000
is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight.

#### bot.time.age

Age of the world, in ticks.


### Events

#### "chat" (username, message, rawMessage)

Only emitted when a player chats publicly.

 * `username` - who said the message (compare with bot.username to ignore your own chat)
 * `message` - stripped of all color and control characters
 * `rawMessage` - unmodified message from the server

Emitted for every server message, including chats.

 * `message` - stripped of all color and control characters

You probably want to wait for the `spawn` event
before doing anything though.

and then emitted when you respawn after death.

This is usually the event that you want to listen to
before doing anything on the server.

Usually you want to ignore this event and wait until the "spawn"
event instead.

server where it is already raining, this event will fire.

is a string explaining why you were kicked.

#### "entityEffectEnd" (entity, effect)
#### "playerJoined" (player)
#### "playerLeft" (player)

#### "blockUpdate" (point)
#### "chunkColumnLoad" (point)
#### "chunkColumnUnload" (point)

Fires when a chunk has updated. `point` is the coordinates to the corner
of the chunk with the smallest x, y, and z values.


#### "noteHeard" (block, instrument, pitch)

Fires when a note block goes off somewhere.

 * `block`: a Block instance, the block at emitted the noise
 * `instrument`:
   - `id`: integer id
   - `name`: one of [`harp`, `doubleBass`, `snareDrum`, `sticks`, `bassDrum`].
 * `pitch`: The pitch of the note (between 0-24 inclusive where 0 is the
   lowest and 24 is the highest). More information about how the pitch values
   correspond to notes in real life are available on the
   [official Minecraft wiki](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Note_Block).

#### "pistonMove" (block, isPulling, direction)

#### "chestLidMove" (block, isOpen)

#### "move"

Fires when the bot moves. If you want the current position, use
`bot.entity.position` and if you want the previous position, use
`bot.entity.position.minus(bot.entity.velocity)`.

#### "mount"

Fires when you mount an entity such as a minecart. To get access
to the entity, use `bot.vehicle`.

To mount an entity, use `mount`.

#### "dismount" (vehicle)

### Functions

#### bot.blockAt(point)

Returns the block at `point` or `null` if that point is not loaded.
See `Block`.

### Methods

#### bot.end()

End the connection with the server.

#### bot.quit(reason)

Gracefully disconnect from the server with the given reason (defaults to 'disconnect.quitting').

#### bot.chat(message)

Sends a publicly broadcast chat message. Breaks up big messages into multiple chat messages as necessary.

#### bot.tell(username, message)

Shortcut for "/tell <username>". All split messages will be whispered to username.

#### bot.setSettings(options)

See the `bot.settings` property.

#### bot.sleep(bedPosition)

Sleep in a bed. `bedPosition` should be a point which contains a bed.

#### bot.wake()

Get out of bed.

#### bot.setControlState(control, state)

 * `control` - one of ['forward', 'back', 'left', 'right', 'jump', 'sprint']
 * `state` - `true` or `false`

#### bot.clearControlStates()

Sets all controls to off.

#### bot.lookAt(point, [force])

 * `point` - tilts your head so that it is directly facing this point.
 * `force` - See `force` in `bot.lookAt`

#### bot.look(yaw, pitch, [force])

Set the direction your head is facing.

 * `yaw` - The number of radians to rotate around the vertical axis, starting
   from due east. Counter clockwise.
 * `pitch` - Number of radians to point up or down. 0 means straight forward.
   pi / 2 means straight up. -pi / 2 means straight down.
 * `force` - If present and true, skips the smooth server-side transition.
   Specify this to true if you need the server to know exactly where you
   are looking, such as for dropping items or shooting arrows. This is not
   needed for client-side calculation such as walking direction.

#### bot.attack(entity)

Attack a player or a mob.

#### bot.mount(entity)

Mount a vehicle. To get back out, use `bot.dismount`.

#### bot.dismount()

Dismounts from the vehicle you are in.

#### bot.updateSign(block, text)

Changes the text on the sign.
