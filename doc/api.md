# API

## Classes

### mineflayer.vec3

See [superjoe30/node-vec3](https://github.com/superjoe30/node-vec3)

All points in mineflayer are supplied as instances of this class.

 * x - south
 * y - up
 * z - west

Functions and methods which require a point argument accept `Vec3` instances
as well as an array with 3 values, and an object with `x`, `y`, and `z`
properties.

### mineflayer.Entity

Entities represent players, mobs, and objects. They are emitted
in many events, and you can access your own entity with `bot.entity`.

#### entity.id

#### entity.type

Choices:

 * `player`
 * `mob`
 * `object`
 * `global` - lightning
 * `orb` - experience orb.

#### entity.username

If the entity type is `player`, this field will be set.

#### entity.mobType

If the entity type is `mob`, this field will be set.

#### entity.objectType

If the entity type is `object`, this field will be set.

#### entity.count

If the entity type is `orb`, this field will be how much experience you
get from collecting the orb.

#### entity.position

#### entity.velocity

#### entity.yaw

#### entity.pitch

#### entity.height

#### entity.onGround

#### entity.equipment[5]

 * `0` - held item
 * `1` - head

#### bot.game.difficulty

#### bot.game.gameMode

#### bot.game.hardcore

#### bot.game.worldHeight

#### bot.game.maxPlayers

#### bot.players

Map of username to people playing the game. A player looks like this:

```js
{
  username: 'player',
  ping: 28,
  entity: entity, // null if you are too far away
}
```

#### bot.isRaining

#### bot.settings.chat

Choices:

Default true, whether or not you receive color codes in chats from the server.

#### bot.settings.viewDistance

Choices:
 * `far` (default)
 * `far`
 * `normal`
 * `short`
 * `tiny`

#### bot.settings.difficulty

#### bot.settings.showCape

If you have a cape you can turn it off by setting this to false.

#### bot.experience.level

#### bot.experience.points

Total experience points.

#### bot.experience.progress

Between 0 and 1 - amount to get to the next level.

#### bot.health

Number in the range [0, 20] representing the number of half-hearts.

#### bot.food

Number, in the range [0, 20] representing the number of half-turkey-legs.

#### bot.foodSaturation

Food saturation acts as a food "overcharge". Food values will not decrease
while the saturation is over zero. Players logging in automatically get a
saturation of 5.0. Eating food increases the saturation as well as the food bar.


#### bot.physics

Edit these numbers to tweak gravity, jump speed, terminal velocity, etc.
Do this at your own risk.

#### bot.time.day

Time of the day, in ticks.

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000
ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long.

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000
is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight.

#### bot.time.age

Age of the world, in ticks.

#### bot.inventory.count

Map of item id to how many you have in your inventory.

#### bot.inventory.slots

Map of slot index to `Item` instance.

#### bot.inventory.quickBarSlot

Which quick bar slot is selected (0 - 8).

#### bot.inventory.selectedItem

In vanilla client, this is the item you are holding with the mouse cursor.

#### bot.targetDigBlock

The `block` that you are currently digging, or `null`.

### Events

#### "chat" (username, message, rawMessage)

Only emitted when a player chats publicly.

 * `username` - who said the message (compare with bot.username to ignore your own chat)
 * `message` - stripped of all color and control characters
 * `rawMessage` - unmodified message from the server

Emitted for every server message, including chats.

 * `message` - stripped of all color and control characters

and then emitted when you respawn after death.

This is usually the event that you want to listen to
before doing anything on the server.

server where it is already raining, this event will fire.

is a string explaining why you were kicked.
