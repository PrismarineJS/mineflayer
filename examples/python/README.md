Thanks to [JSPyBridge](https://github.com/extremeheat/JSPyBridge), it is possible to use mineflayer in python!


### Install

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed and also Node.js 14 or newer. You can get them from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://nodejs.org/.

You can access mineflayer in Python in addition to any other JavaScript package by first installing the javascript pip package:

```sh
pip install javascript
```


Once you have the package installed, you can put this at the top of your Python:

```py
from javascript import require
mineflayer = require('mineflayer')
```

... and you're good to go, with full API access. You interact with the API very similarly to JavaScript.
