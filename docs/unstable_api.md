# unstable API : bot._

These methods and classes are useful in some special cases but are not stable and can change at any moment.

## bot._chunkColumn(x, z)

Return the column at `x` and `y`. A column has :

 * a `blockType`
 * a `light`
 * a `skylight`
 * a `biome`
 
`blockType`, `light` and `skylight` are arrays of size 16.

## bot._client

`bot._client` is created using [node-minecraft-protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol).
It handles writing and reading packet.
Its behaviour can change (for example at each new minecraft version) so it's better to use mineflayer methods if possible.
