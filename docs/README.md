## Contribute

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [prismarine-contribute](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-contribute)

## Usage

Without version specified, the version of the server will be guessed automatically, you can set a specific one using the version option.
For example `version:"1.8"`.

### Echo Example
```js
var mineflayer = require('mineflayer')

var bot = mineflayer.createBot({
  host: 'localhost', // optional
  port: 25565,       // optional
  username: 'email@example.com', // email and password are required only for
  password: '12345678',          // online-mode=true servers
  version: false                 // false corresponds to auto version detection (that's the default), put for example "1.8.8" if you need a specific version
})

bot.on('chat', function (username, message) {
  if (username === bot.username) return
  bot.chat(message)
})

bot.on('error', err => console.log(err))
```

### Modules

A lot of the active development is happening inside of small npm packages which are used by mineflayer.

#### The Node Way&trade;

> "When applications are done well, they are just the really application-specific, brackish residue that can't be so easily abstracted away. All the nice, reusable components sublimate away onto github and npm where everybody can collaborate to advance the commons." â€” substack from ["how I write modules"](https://gist.github.com/substack/5075355)

#### Modules

### Debug

You can enable some protocol debugging output using `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG="minecraft-protocol" node [...]
```

On windows :
```
set DEBUG=minecraft-protocol
node your_script.js
```

## Testing

Some setup is required after first cloning the project but after that is done it's very easy to run them.

### Setup

In order to get all tests to run successfully you must first:

1. create a new folder in which to store minecraft server jars
2. set the MC_SERVER_JAR_DIR to this folder

Example:

1. `mkdir server_jars`
2. `export MC_SERVER_JAR_DIR=/full/path/to/server_jars`

Where the "/full/path/to/" is the fully qualified path name.

### Testing everything

Simply run: `npm test`

### Testing specific version
Run `npm test -g <version>`, where `<version>` is a minecraft version like `1.12`, `1.15.2`...

### Testing specific test
Run `npm test -g <test_name>`, where `<test_name>` is a name of the test like `bed`, `useChests`, `rayTrace`...
