 * upgrade to minecraft-protocol 0.7.0
   - `mineflayer.createBot` no longer takes a `email` argument.
   - The `username` and `password` arguments are used to authenticate with the
     official minecraft servers and determine the case-correct username. If
     you have migrated your user account to a mojang login, `username` looks
     like an email address.
   - If you leave out the `password` argument, `username` is used to connect
     directly to the server. In this case you will get kicked if the server is
     in online mode.
